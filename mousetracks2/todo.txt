[MVP]
- ctypes app detection
- [GUI] reworked map types  - cursor[sequential|density|speed] click[L|M|R][single|double|held|] thumb[L|R][seq|den|spd] keyboard[pres|held]
- Detect spawned processes closed via task manager (currently not detected)
- Store last size for use with resize timer and only update+draw if not none and changed
- [Config] Enable / disable each type of tracking
- [GUI] App close timeout

[Bugs]
- disable.mtk2 is being saved
- [GUI] Stopped updating after sleep but processing was still printing out, failed with elapsed check

[QOL]
- Store previous render in case of background thread busy, show blank image if not
- Queue multiple render requests

[Low Priority]
- Option to disable multi monitor handling, track both separately
- Export CSV
- Handle multiple windows from the same process if they have the same PID (eg. HP Anyware/Teradici)
- Add optional padding around heatmaps
- [GUI] Show pause/play overlay when hoving on live preview, click to pause/unpause
- [Config] Choose network interfaces to show
- User friendly API (eg. from mousetracks2.api import profile, render; render(profile('main'), type='mouse clicks'))
- When attempting to save while unable to, make sure messages are sent back so that the process doesn't close
- Gamepad rendering
- [GUI] Option to show console
- Option to run as elevated
- Move start tracking signal to hub instead of GUI

[Future Ideas]
- Per button click heatmaps
- Store last X hours in history, scroll back in time.
- Combine renders with different colours (eg. lmb as red, mmb as blue, rmb as green, or game1 as BlackToRed, game2 as BlackToBlue)
